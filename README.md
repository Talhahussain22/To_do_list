This Python script creates a simple GUI application using tkinter for adding and deleting items in a Treeview widget. The application allows users to add items to the Treeview and delete selected items.

The Add function adds an item to the Treeview. It checks if the entry field is empty and raises an exception if so, which is caught and shows a messagebox with a message to enter something.
The Delete function deletes the selected item from the Treeview. It gets the selected item's index using treeview.selection() and deletes it using treeview.delete(selection).
The main window (m) is configured with a size of 800x500 pixels. It contains a Treeview widget for displaying items, two buttons for adding and deleting items, and an entry field for entering new items.

This script provides a basic example of using tkinter to create a simple GUI application for managing items in a list-like structure
